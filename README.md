| **Method**                               | **Description**                                                                 | **Key Concepts**                                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Highest Sharpe Ratio Optimization**    | Maximizes the Sharpe Ratio, achieving the highest possible return per unit of risk. | Sharpe Ratio = (Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Portfolio Standard Deviation                  |
| **Minimum Volatility Portfolio**         | Constructs a portfolio with the lowest possible volatility regardless of expected returns. | Variance, Volatility Minimization                                                                 |
| **Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization** | Maximizes expected return for a given level of risk, or minimizes risk for a given level of expected return. | Efficient Frontier, Risk-Return Trade-off                                                          |
| **Value at Risk (VaR) Optimization**     | Estimates the maximum loss over a specified period for a given confidence interval, and minimizes potential losses. | Confidence Interval, Maximum Expected Loss                                                        |
| **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**   | Estimates an asset's expected return based on systematic risk, and builds a portfolio aligned with the investor's risk tolerance. | Risk-Free Rate, Beta, Market Return                                                               |
| **Black-Litterman Model**                | Adjusts expected returns based on investor views and market equilibrium, combining CAPM with subjective views. | Investor Views, Market Equilibrium, Adjusted Expected Returns                                     |
| **Risk Parity**                          | Allocates capital based on risk contribution rather than dollar amounts, equalizing the risk contribution of each asset class. | Risk Allocation, Equal Risk Contribution                                                          |
| **Maximum Diversification**              | Maximizes the diversification ratio, achieving better diversification benefits. | Diversification Ratio, Asset Volatilities                                                         |
| **Mean-CVaR Optimization**               | Considers both expected return and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), minimizing the potential for extreme losses. | Tail Risk, Expected Shortfall                                                                     |
| **Multi-Factor Models**                  | Incorporates multiple factors (such as size, value, momentum) that explain asset returns, achieving better risk-adjusted returns. | Factor Exposure, Diversification Across Factors                                                   |
